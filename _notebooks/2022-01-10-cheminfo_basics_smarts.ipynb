    "\n",
    "SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) is a lanuguage used to search, select, and match a substructure pattern in a molecule SMILE. The idea of SMARTS is reminiscent of regular expressions (regex) for texts. Following some pre-defined rules for searching, SMARTS offer a powerful way to systematically search though a large corpus of molecules for a particular chemical phenotype. \n",
    "\n",
    "More details on the SMARTS and its 'grammar' can be found on the Daylight's [official page](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Few words of caution: \n",
    "* SMILES represent _whole_ molecule (graph), SMARTS identify a substructure (subgraph). \n",
    "* All SMILES are valid SMARTS \n",
    "* It is better to be precise with your query than be general (you dont know what it might hit if not meticulous)\n",
    "> For instance, the SMILES O means an aliphatic oxygen with zero charge and two hydrogens, i.e. water. In SMARTS, the same expression means any aliphatic oxygen regardless of charge, hydrogen count, etc, e.g. it will match the oxygen in water, but also those in ethanol, acetone, molecular oxygen, hydroxy and hydronium ions, etc. Specifying [OH2] limits the pattern to match only water (this is also the fully specified SMILES for water)."

# Welcome! 

Blog documenting my mulling over and tinkering with data and science.

This blog is a compilations of tips, learnings, and tests revolving in the area of data science, machine learning, with some flavor of chemical science. The listed notebooks and posts are meant to be a reference for my future self and whoever wishes to start dabbling in this space. This is my first time venturing in to the world of blogging and is definitely a work in progress. 

This blog is generated using the (fastpages blogging platform)[https://github.com/fastai/fastpages].
> fastpages uses GitHub Actions to simplify the process of creating Jekyll blog posts on GitHub Pages from a variety of input formats.

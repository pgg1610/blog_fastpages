Hello, I am Pushkar Ghanekar. 

This blog is a compilation of tinkerings, learnings, and helpful tips I have accumulated in the area of data science and machine learning, with some flavor of chemical science sprinkled sporadically. The posts are meant to be a reference for my future self and whoever wishes to start dabbling in the data science and ML space. 

This is my first-ever venture in the world of blogging and is definitely a work in progress. Would love hear what you think! 

You can check out my personal website [here](http://pushkarghanekar.com). 

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].

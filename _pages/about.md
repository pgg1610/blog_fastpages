Hello, I am Pushkar Ghanekar. Currently, I am working at the intersection chemical science, computational modeling, and dabbling in machine learning as and when necessary. This is my first-ever venture in the world of blogging and is definitely a work in progress. Would love hear what you think! 

You can check out my personal website [here](http://pushkarghanekar.com)

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1]. After years of trying out different templates to host my Jupyter notebooks, this service is by far the most convenient and robust out there. 

[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.

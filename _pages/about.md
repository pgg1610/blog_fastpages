Data aesthete at heart, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Davidson School of Chemical Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) at Purdue University, advised by [Jeffrey P. Greeley](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=84163). Understanding molecular-level behavior of the catalyst through data and science is at the heart of my Ph.D. research. 

Besides research, I enjoy teaching and making scientific ideas accessible to the public. I have taught introductory chemistry and mathematics to middle-schoolers, and have assisted in designing modules that introduce critical thinking, logical reasoning, and coding in high-school curricula.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking [(link to some latest experiments)](https://www.instagram.com/pgg1610/), gaming, diving deep in arcane internet rabbit holes, reading philosophy, and going on longer-than-necessary bike rides.

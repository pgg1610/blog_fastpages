## Specific Articles 

Few key papers which I have found useful when learning more about the state-of-the-art in Cheminformatics. I've tried to categorize them roughly based on their area of application: 

### Representation

Comparative study of descriptor-based and graph-based models using public data set. Used descriptor-based models (XGBoost, RF, SVM, using ECFP) and compared them to graph-based models (GCN, GAT, AttentiveFP, MPNN). They show descriptor-based models outperform the graph-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency with SVM having best predictions. Graph-based methods are good for multi-task learning.

Combine structure (Graph-networks) and descriptor based features (QM-derived) to predict activation energies (E2/SN2 barrier height prediction) and regioselectivity. Incorporating QM and structure leads to better overall accuracy and generalizability even in low data regions. Atom and bond level features derived using QM and used in the model generation with a smaller dataset.

Test SOTA language models and representation performance against graph-based methods (CGVAE, JTVAE) for 'challenging' generative modeling tasks - generate a molecule - property distribution as a function of synthetic feasiblity. Graph models faced chanllenge in generating large molcules (> 100 HAs). Selfies provided advantage here. All of the models seem to generate novel molecules - how practical each of these novel molecules are is yet an open question. 

* [MOSES - Benchmarking platform for generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12823).

Propose a platform to deploy and compare state-of-the-art generative models for exploring molecular space on same dataset. In addition the authors also propose list of metrics  to evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated structures.

Interesting analysis from team at AstraZeneca R&D. They look at the chemical space coverage accounted by the SOTA generative models. Proposes a metric for evaluating space coverage, and thereby comparing different SOTA models, using a reference data (GDB-13 in this case). The new metric computes how much of the GDB-13 dataset can be recovered by a model that is trained on small GDB subset.  Generative models were trained on same 1M data points and 1B molecules were then sampled from each model. It was seen that at most 39% of the molecules in the parent dataset were sampled / generated by the model. Most models sampled the same compounds atleast twice. It was observed that graph-based model sampled much diverse molecules than string-based methods. Besides, the coverage of GAN-based models was worse compared to Language and Graph models.
